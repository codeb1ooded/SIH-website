### Problem: Non-availability of teachers in government schools
### According to Sustainable Development Goal No 4: To fulfill the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. Currently, India is facing significant challenge with regard to shortages of trained primary school teachers. Besides, there is an issue of proxy/para teachers engaged in teaching at Primary and Secondary levels thereby affecting the quality of teaching and learning amongst students. To overcome this challenge, a digitised teacher tracking system may be developed to locate schools with shortage of teachers w.r.t the norms given in RTE Act, 2009.
