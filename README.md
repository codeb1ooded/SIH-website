### Problem: Non-availability of Teachers in Government Schools
### According to Sustainable Development Goal No 4: To fulfill the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. Currently, India is facing significant challenge with regard to shortages of trained primary school teachers. Besides, there is an issue of proxy/para teachers engaged in teaching at Primary and Secondary levels thereby affecting the quality of teaching and learning amongst students. To overcome this challenge, a digitised teacher tracking system may be developed to locate schools with shortage of teachers w.r.t the norms given in RTE Act, 2009.

</ul>


###Breaking down the problem:

<ul>
<li>Proxy/Para Teachers: Here, the issue is that some teachers who are enrolled at a govt. school send someone else who might be unqualified at the school, due to which the students suffer.</li>
<li>Student Teacher Ratio: Limited availability of teachers in rural areas and even populated areas is a big issue in India. Increasing this effect is a problem that the student teacher ratio is not updated frequently due to unavailability of a tracking system. </li>
</ul>


With our tool/software, we aim to solve both the problems with the use of internet and other technologies at hand and make it a cost effective solution.


### Solutions Offered
<ol>
<li>Android application for real time tracking of the location of the teachers, for marking their attendance.</li>
<li>Web application which helps the administrators at different cluster levels to analyse the current status of teachers in terms of availability with the ease to track down to a specific person on whom some action might need to be taken. It will also help in suggesting some solutions on the regions which need action from the government</li>
</ol>

### Features at a glance

>> Android Application
<ol>
<li>Teacher registration</li>
<li>Teacher authentication and attendance using 3 methods: Biometric (Fingerprint Scanner), GPS and Bluetooth</li>
<li>Feature for teacher to track his/her own attendance</li>
<li>Upload qualification documents which will be sent to the cloud server to maintain a single repository (future scope)</li>
</ol>

## Looking at making the system more independent of human intervention, after analysing options like image processing (face recognition), voice recognition, biometrics and some more options, we propose with a new solution which is as follows:

<ul>
<li>Installation of biometric fingerprint scanner in every classroom of government school<li>
<li>Register all the teachers in schools to the database and record their fingerprints to the cloud based database.</li>
<li>The fingerprint scanner will be connected to the internet or a local server.</li>
<li>The teacher will be required to mark their attendance at the beginning of each period/lecture.</li>
<li>This will ensure that the teacher remains in the school and also that it is independent of the condition whether the teacher has a mobile or not.</li>
</ul>

### This complete solution will assist in solving the problem statement as follows:
<ul>
<li>Provide live/real time data if student teacher ratio based on the attendance</li>
<li>Ensure that the teacher has to be in school/institution</li>
<li>Display data by grouping it into different clusters, states, zones, cities, schools and view data of the individual teacher</li>
<li>Looking at the number of teachers which a school needs or the number of teachers which is surplus in another school, we can suggest transfering/exporting teacher from one school to another.</li>
</ul>
